# Counting Bits

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return  *an array* `ans` *of length* `n + 1` *such that for each* `i` (`0 <= i <= n`) *,* `ans[i]` *is the  **number of*** `1` ***'s**  in the binary representation of *`i`.

Do not solve it with built-in functions (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++).

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= n <= 105

 

 **Follow up:** 

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?

## Solution

**Language:** Java  
**Runtime:** 2 ms (beats 96.01%)  
**Memory:** 48.8 MB (beats 30.51%)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] arr = new int[n + 1];
        int a = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (a * 2 == i) {
                a = i;
            }
            arr[i] = arr[i - a] + 1;
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
```
